    "Q6. Why is it important to understand the level of measurement when analyzing data? Provide an example to illustrate your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Knowing the level of measurement of your data is important for two reasons. \n",
    "\n",
    "1.Each of the levels of measurement provides a different level of detail.  Nominal provides the least amount of detail, ordinal provides the next highest amount of detail, and interval and ratio provide the most amount of detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "ex:-\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nominal level variable, values are grouped into categories that have no meaningful order.  For example, gender and political affiliation are nominal level variables.  Members in the group are assigned a label in that group and there is no hierarchy.  Typical descriptive statistics associated with nominal data are frequencies and percentages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal level variables are nominal level variables with a meaningful order.  For example, horse race winners can be assigned labels of first, second, third, fourth, etc. and these labels have an ordered relationship among them (i.e., first is higher than second, second is higher than third, and so on).  As with nominal level variables, ordinal level variables are typically described with frequencies and percentages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interval and ratio level variables (also called continuous level variables) have the most detail associated with them.  Mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division can be accurately applied to the values of these variables.  An example variable would be the amount of milk used in cookie recipe (measured in cups).  This variable has arithmetic properties such that 2 cups of milk is exactly twice as much as 1 cup of milk.  Additionally, the difference between 1 and 2 cups of milk is exactly the same as the difference between 2 and 3 cups of milk.  Interval and ratio level variables are typically described using means and standard deviations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.The second reason levels of measurement are important to know is because different statistical tests are appropriate for variables with different levels of measurement.  For example, chi-square tests of independence are most appropriate for nominal level data.  The Mann-Whitney U test is most appropriate for an ordinal level dependent variable and a nominal level independent variable.  An ANOVA is most appropriate for a continuous level dependent variable and a nominal level independent variable. "

    "The three commonly used measures of central tendency are the \n",
    "\n",
    "1.mean:- The mean is the arithmetic average. Calculating the mean is very simple, we just add up all of the values and divide by the number of observations in our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.median:- The median is the middle value. It is the value that splits the dataset in half, making it a natural measure of central tendency.\n",
    "To find the median,we order our data from smallest to largest, and then find the data point that has an equal number of values above it and below it.\n",
    "The method for locating the median varies slightly depending on whether our dataset has an even or odd number of values.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A statistic that tells us how the data values are dispersed or spread out is called the measure of dispersion or measure of variation in data.\n",

    "1.Standard Deviation:- Standard deviation is a statistic that measures the dispersion of a dataset relative to its mean and is calculated as the square root of the variance. \n",
    "It tells how far each score lies from the mean. In normal distributions, a high standard deviation means that values are generally far from the mean, while a low standard deviation indicates that values are clustered close to the mean.\n",
