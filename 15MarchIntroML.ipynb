    "1.Artificial Intelligence:- Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of machines and computer programs to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem solving, decision-making, language understanding, and perception. AI is achieved by creating computer algorithms and systems that can learn from data and adapt to new situations, and can perform tasks autonomously without human intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Machine Learning:- Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to enable computer systems to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. In other words, machine learning algorithms are designed to identify patterns in data and use those patterns to make decisions or predictions about new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Deep Learning:- Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that involves training artificial neural networks to learn from data and make predictions or decisions. Deep learning networks are modeled after the structure and function of the human brain, and they consist of multiple layers of interconnected nodes, known as neurons."

    "\n",
    "Ans. The main differences between supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised learning are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Supervised Learning: In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset, which means that each data point has a predefined label or target variable. The goal of the algorithm is to learn a function that can predict the label of new, unseen data points based on their input features. Supervised learning is used for tasks such as classification and regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Unsupervised Learning: In unsupervised learning, the algorithm is trained on an unlabeled dataset, which means that there are no predefined labels or target variables. The goal of the algorithm is to learn the underlying structure or patterns in the data. Unsupervised learning is used for tasks such as clustering, anomaly detection, and dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Semi-Supervised Learning: In semi-supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a dataset that contains both labeled and unlabeled data points. The goal of the algorithm is to use the labeled data to learn a function that can predict the labels of the unlabeled data points. Semi-supervised learning is useful when obtaining labeled data is expensive or time-consuming."

    "Q6. What is train, test and validation split? Explain the importance of each term.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Train, test, and validation split is a common technique used in machine learning to evaluate the performance of a model. The dataset is divided into three parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Training set: This is the largest part of the dataset and is used to train the model. The model learns from the input data and the corresponding output labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Test set: This is a smaller part of the dataset that is used to evaluate the performance of the model. The test set is used to measure how well the model can generalize to new, unseen data. The test set is only used once after the model is trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Validation set: This is an optional part of the dataset that is used during the training phase to tune the hyperparameters of the model. The validation set is used to evaluate the performance of the model on new, unseen data that is not part of the training set. The validation set is also used to prevent overfitting, which occurs when the model is too complex and performs well on the training set but poorly on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of each term is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Training set: The training set is used to train the model, and it is important because the model learns from this data. The quality and quantity of the training data can have a significant impact on the performance of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Test set: The test set is used to evaluate the performance of the model on new, unseen data. It is important because it provides an unbiased estimate of the performance of the model. If the model performs well on the test set, it is likely to perform well on new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Validation set: The validation set is used to tune the hyperparameters of the model and to prevent overfitting. It is important because it helps to optimize the performance of the model and ensure that it generalizes well to new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the train, test, and validation split is a technique used to evaluate the performance of a model in machine learning. It is important to use all three sets to ensure that the model is optimized for performance, generalization, and prevention of overfitting."
