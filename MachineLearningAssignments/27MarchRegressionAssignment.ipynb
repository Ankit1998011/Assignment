    "Ans. R-squared (R2) is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable(s) in a linear regression model. It is often used to evaluate the goodness of fit of a regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "-->R-squared takes values between 0 and 1. A value of 1 means that all the variability in the dependent variable can be explained by the regression model, and a value of 0 means that none of the variability can be explained by the model. A higher R-squared value typically indicates a better fit of the model to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "-->To calculate R-squared, we first calculate the total sum of squares (SST), which is the sum of the squared differences between each observation of the dependent variable and the mean of the dependent variable. Then, we calculate the sum of squares of the residuals (SSR), which is the sum of the squared differences between each observation of the dependent variable and its predicted value from the regression model. Finally, we calculate R-squared as the ratio of SSR to SST, or 1 minus the ratio of SSE to SST, where SSE is the sum of the squared errors from the regression model."

    "-->Adjusted R-squared is a modified version of R-squared that adjusts for the number of independent variables in a regression model. It takes into account the fact that simply adding more independent variables to a model can lead to an increase in R-squared, even if those variables do not have a significant impact on the dependent variable. Adjusted R-squared penalizes the addition of independent variables that do not improve the model's goodness of fit.\n",

    "Ans. Adjusted R-squared is more appropriate to use when evaluating a regression model containing multiple independent variables. This is because the regular R-squared value tends to increase as more independent variables are added to the model, even if those variables do not improve the fit significantly. Adjusted R-squared takes into account the number of independent variables in the model and penalizes the addition of irrelevant variables, resulting in a more accurate evaluation of the model's fit to the data. Therefore, adjusted R-squared should be used in conjunction with the regular R-squared value when evaluating the goodness of fit of a regression model with multiple independent variables."

    "- It gives a measure of how far off the predicted values are from the actual values in the same units as the dependent variable.\n",
    "- It penalizes large errors more than small errors due to the squaring operation.\n",
    "- It is widely used in machine learning applications.\n",

    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "- It is highly sensitive to outliers due to the squaring operation, which can make the metric unreliable if there are a few very large errors.\n",
    "- Small errors squared can dominate the RMS error, leading to a high RMS error even if the model is performing well overall.\n",
    "- It can be more difficult to interpret than other metrics due to the square root operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "MSE:\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "- It gives a measure of how far off the predicted values are from the actual values in a useful unit (i.e., the square of the unit of the dependent variable).\n",
    "- It is technically easy to compute and widely used in machine learning applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "- It is highly sensitive to outliers due to the squaring operation, which can make the metric unreliable if there are a few very large errors.\n",

    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "- It gives a measure of how far off the predicted values are from the actual values in the same unit as the dependent variable.\n",
    "- It is less sensitive to outliers since it uses absolute values instead of squaring.\n",
    "- It is easier to interpret than RMSE and MSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "- It may be less appropriate if you want to penalize large errors more (RMSE would be preferred in this case).\n",
    "- It does not take into account the distribution of the residuals and the impact of skewed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, RMSE, MSE, and MAE are commonly used evaluation metrics in regression analysis, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages depending on the problem and the underlying data distribution. It is often recommended to consider multiple metrics in conjunction and evaluate the results in a more comprehensive way."

    "Regularized linear models use techniques such as Ridge regression and Lasso regression to add a penalty term to the loss function, which helps prevent overfitting by limiting the size of the coefficients and preventing them from becoming too large.

    "let's consider a linear regression model with three variables: x1, x2, and x3. If x1 and x2 are important predictors and have large coefficients, while x3 is less important but has a small coefficient, the model may be overfit as it is giving too much weight to x1 and x2. To reduce overfitting, a regularization technique such as Lasso regression could be used, which would add a penalty for the magnitude of the coefficients and shrink the coefficients towards zero. In this case, Lasso may output a model where the coefficient for x3 is exactly zero and x1 and x2 are shrunk towards smaller values, resulting in a simpler and more interpretable model that is less prone to overfitting.\n",

    "While regularized linear models can be effective in preventing overfitting, there are some limitations and cases when they may not be the best choice for regression analysis. Here are some limitations of regularized linear models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Model Interpretability: Regularized models can be more difficult to interpret than traditional linear regression, particularly when using Lasso due to the possibility of variable selection and sparse solutions. This can make it challenging to understand the relationship between the predictors and the response variable.\n",

    "4.Nonlinear Relationships: Regularized linear models work well only with linear relationships between predictors and response variable. If there is nonlinearity present in the data, then other regression techniques like decision trees, random forests or kernel regression would be more appropriate.\n",

    "5.Requires Scaling: Regularization assumes that all the variables have been scaled so that no one variable dominates the others.\n",

    "In summary, regularized linear models may not always be the best choice for regression analysis if interpretability is critical, outliers are present in the data, feature space is large, or if the relationship between predictors and the response variable is nonlinear.
