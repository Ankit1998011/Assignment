    "Lasso Regression is a linear regression technique that, like Ridge Regression, introduces a regularization term to the cost function to improve the model's performance. The difference between Lasso Regression and Ridge Regression is that Lasso Regression estimates the coefficients by minimizing the sum of the absolute values of the residuals, while Ridge Regression estimates the coefficients by minimizing the sum of the squares of the residuals. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, Lasso Regression is able to produce sparser models than Ridge Regression by setting the coefficients of less important or redundant features to exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection. This property can be useful when dealing with high-dimensional datasets with many irrelevant or redundant features, as it can improve the model's interpretability and reduce overfitting. On the other hand, Ridge Regression is better suited to situations where all features are potentially relevant and the emphasis is on reducing the variance of the coefficient estimates. In practice, the choice between Lasso Regression and Ridge Regression (or a combination of both, called Elastic Net Regression) depends on the specific problem and the characteristics of the dataset."

As a result, if a coefficient is exactly zero, it is likely that the corresponding feature was not important for predicting the dependent variable, and can be safely excluded from the model. \n",
