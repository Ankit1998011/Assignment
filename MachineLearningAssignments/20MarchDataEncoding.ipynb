    "Data encoding:- is the process of converting data from one representation to another, often to facilitate analysis or machine learning tasks. In data science, data encoding is used to transform categorical or textual data into a numerical form, so that it can be fed into machine learning models or used for statistical analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are several types of data encoding techniques, such as:-\n",
    "\n",
    "1.one-hot encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "2.ordinal encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "3.binary encoding. \n",
    "\n",
    "->One-hot encoding is a technique that assigns a unique binary value to each category in a categorical variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "->Ordinal encoding involves assigning integer values to categorical variables based on their rank or order in a given dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "->Binary encoding, on the other hand, involves using binary values to represent ordinal values derived from categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data encoding is important in data science because machine learning models require numerical data to learn from. By encoding categorical or textual data, data scientists can expand the range of data available for analysis and develop more accurate and effective predictive models. Encoding also helps in reducing storage requirements and speeds up the data processing time, making it easier to handle large datasets.\n",

    "Overall, data encoding is an essential tool in data science for data preparation and machine learning tasks."

    "To perform a segmentation analysis, we need to convert these categorical variables into numerical form, as many machine learning models are unable to process categorical data directly. With nominal encoding, we can assign a unique integer value to each category for each variable. For example, we can assign a value of 1 for female, 2 for male under the gender category. Under the location category, we can assign a value of 1 for India, 2 for Japan, and so on.\n",
