    "Simple linear regression--> is a statistical model that shows the relationship between two variables with a linear equation, where one variable is the independent variable and the other is the dependent variable. The independent variable is used to predict the dependent variable using a straight line. For example, a simple linear regression can be used to predict the price of a house based on its size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple linear regression--> on the other hand, is used when there are two or more independent variables that are used to predict the dependent variable. The relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables can be modeled using a linear equation. For example, multiple linear regression can be used to predict a person's salary based on their education level, years of experience, and age.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the primary difference between simple linear regression and multiple linear regression is the number of independent variables used in the model. While simple linear regression uses only one independent variable to predict the dependent variable, multiple linear regression uses more than one independent variable."
