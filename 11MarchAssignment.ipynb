    "Q1: What is the difference between a t-test and a z-test? Provide an example scenario where you would use each type of test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. A t-test and a z-test are both statistical tests used to make inferences about a population based on a sample of data. The main difference between the two is the assumptions they make about the population's standard deviation. \n",
    "\n",
    "A z-test is used when the population's standard deviation is known, or when the sample size is very large. For example, if we want to test whether a sample mean is significantly different from a hypothesized population mean, and we know the population's standard deviation, we can use a z-test. Another scenario where a z-test can be used is in quality control, when the population's standard deviation can be estimated based on historical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a t-test is used when the population's standard deviation is unknown and must be estimated from the sample data. The t-test is also used when the sample size is small. For example, if we want to test whether there is a significant difference between the means of two independent samples, we can use a two-sample t-test. Another scenario where a t-test is commonly used is in biomedical research, where sample sizes are often limited and the population's standard deviation can be difficult to estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a z-test is preferred when the population's standard deviation is known, or when the sample size is large, while a t-test is preferred when the population's standard deviation is unknown and the sample size is small.\n",
    "\n",
    "->Example Scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a pharmaceutical company produces a new drug and wants to test whether the drug is effective in reducing patients' blood pressure. The company takes a sample of 30 patients and administers the drug to them, then measures their blood pressure after the treatment. Since the population's standard deviation is unknown, the company should use a t-test to determine whether the drug is effective."

    "Q2: Differentiate between one-tailed and two-tailed tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. One-tailed and two-tailed tests are types of hypothesis tests that are used to determine whether there is a significant difference between a sample statistic and a population parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "A one-tailed test is a hypothesis test where the alternative hypothesis is directional, meaning it predicts the direction of the difference between the sample statistic and the population parameter. For example, a one-tailed test might be used to determine whether a new drug increases blood pressure. The null hypothesis would be that the drug has no effect on blood pressure, and the alternative hypothesis would be that the drug increases blood pressure. The one-tailed test would reject the null hypothesis if the blood pressure increase is statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "A two-tailed test is a hypothesis test where the alternative hypothesis is non-directional, meaning it predicts that there is a difference between the sample statistic and the population parameter, but it does not predict the direction of the difference. For example, a two-tailed test might be used to determine whether a coin is fair. The null hypothesis would be that the coin is fair, and the alternative hypothesis would be that the coin is biased in either direction. The two-tailed test would reject the null hypothesis if the coin toss results are statistically significant in either direction.\n",

    "Q3: Explain the concept of Type 1 and Type 2 errors in hypothesis testing. Provide an example scenario for each type of error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. In hypothesis testing, there are two types of errors that can occur: Type I errors and Type II errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type I error occurs when a null hypothesis is rejected, even though it is actually true. In other words, a Type I error occurs when we incorrectly conclude that there is a significant difference between a sample statistic and a population parameter, when in fact, the difference is due to chance. The probability of making a Type I error is denoted by alpha (α) and is typically set at 0.05 or 0.01.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose a company is testing a new product to see if it increases sales. The null hypothesis would be that the product has no effect on sales. A Type I error would occur if the company rejected the null hypothesis and concluded that the product does increase sales, even though it actually has no effect.\n",

    "Type II error occurs when a null hypothesis is not rejected, even though it is actually false. In other words, a Type II error occurs when we incorrectly conclude that there is no significant difference between a sample statistic and a population parameter, when in fact, there is a real difference. The probability of making a Type II error is denoted by beta (β).\n",

A Type II error would occur if the researcher failed to reject the null hypothesis and concluded that the drug has no effect on blood pressure, even though it actually does lower blood pressure.\n",

    "Q4: Explain Bayes's theorem with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Bayes's theorem is a mathematical formula that describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. It was named after the Reverend Thomas Bayes, an 18th-century British statistician.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes's theorem states that the probability of an event A, given the occurrence of event B, can be calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A|B) is the probability of event A given event B (also known as the posterior probability).\n",
    "\n",
    "P(B|A) is the probability of event B given event A (also known as the likelihood).\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A) is the prior probability of event A.\n",
    "\n",
    "P(B) is the prior probability of event B.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand this theorem better, let's consider an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose there is a medical test to detect a rare disease that only affects 1 in 1,000 people in the population. The test is 99% accurate, meaning that it correctly identifies 99% of people who have the disease and 99% of people who do not have the disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a person tests positive for the disease, what is the probability that they actually have the disease?\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Bayes's theorem, we can calculate the probability as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A) = the prior probability of having the disease = 1/1000 = 0.001\n",
    "\n",
    "P(B|A) = the probability of testing positive given that the person has the disease = 0.99\n",
    "\n",
    "P(B|not A) = the probability of testing positive given that the person does not have the disease = 0.01\n",
    "\n",
    "P(B) = the probability of testing positive = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B|not A) * P(not A) = 0.99 * 0.001 + 0.01 * 0.999 = 0.01098\n",

    "P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B) = 0.99 * 0.001 / 0.01098 = 0.090\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that if a person tests positive for the disease, the probability of actually having the disease is only 9%. Even though the test is highly accurate, the low prevalence of the disease in the population makes it less likely that a positive test result indicates the presence of the disease."

    "Q5: What is a confidence interval? How to calculate the confidence interval, explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. A confidence interval is a range of values that provides an estimate for an unknown population parameter, such as a mean or a proportion, based on a sample of data. The confidence interval expresses the degree of uncertainty associated with the estimate, and represents the range of values that we can be reasonably confident contains the true population parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate a confidence interval, we first need to determine the level of confidence that we want to have in our estimate. The level of confidence is typically set at 95%, meaning that if we were to repeat the sampling procedure many times, about 95% of the intervals we calculate would contain the true population parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example to illustrate the calculation of a confidence interval:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to estimate the mean height of adult males in a certain population. We take a random sample of 100 males and measure their heights. The sample mean height is calculated as 180 cm, with a sample standard deviation of 10 cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate a 95% confidence interval for the true population mean height, we can use the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "CI = Xbar +/- z*(s/sqrt(n))\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "-Xbar is the sample mean height\n",
    "\n",
    "-s is the sample standard deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "-n is the sample size\n",
    "\n",
    "-z is the critical value from the standard normal distribution that corresponds to our chosen level of confidence (1.96 for 95% confidence)\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting the values, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "CI = 180 +/- 1.96*(10/sqrt(100))\n",
    "\n",
    "CI = 180 +/- 1.96\n",
    "\n",
    "CI = (178.04, 181.96)\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we can say with 95% confidence that the true population mean height is between 178.04 cm and 181.96 cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a confidence interval is a range of values that provides an estimate for an unknown population parameter, and typically expresses the degree of uncertainty associated with the estimate. The calculation of the interval involves determining the level of confidence, as well as the sample mean, sample standard deviation, sample size, and critical value from the relevant distribution."

    "Suppose there is a rare disease that affects 0.1% of the population. A medical test has a false positive rate of 5% (meaning it incorrectly indicates that a person has the disease 5% of the time) and a false negative rate of 1% (meaning it incorrectly indicates that a person does not have the disease 1% of the time). If a person tests positive for the disease, what is the probability that they actually have the disease?\n",

    "The margin of error is affected by several factors, including the level of confidence, the sample size, and the variability of the data.

We want to estimate the percentage with 95% confidence, and we want the margin of error to be no more than 3%. A small sample size, say 100 voters, might not accurately represent the larger population of voters, and the margin of error could be larger than desired. However, a larger sample size, say 1000 or more, would likely provide a more accurate estimate and a smaller margin of error, allowing us to make more precise predictions about the population as a whole.\n",
