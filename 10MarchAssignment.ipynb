    "Q1: What is Estimation Statistics? Explain point estimate and interval estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Estimation Statistics is a branch of statistics that deals with the process of estimating or approximating a population parameter based on a sample from that population. It involves using statistical techniques to infer information about a population from a sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of estimates that can be made using estimation statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.point estimates \n",
    "\n",
    "2.interval estimates \n",
    "\n",
    "-> A point estimate is a single value that is used to approximate a population parameter. For example, the sample mean can be used as a point estimate of the population mean. Point estimates are relatively easy to compute, but they do not provide any information about the accuracy of the estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "-> Interval estimates, on the other hand, provide a range of values that are likely to contain the true population parameter. A confidence interval is a type of interval estimate that has a specified level of confidence associated with it. For example, we might say that we are 95% confident that the true population mean lies within a certain range of values. Interval estimates are generally more informative than point estimates because they provide information about the accuracy of the estimate."

    "Q3: What is Hypothesis testing? Why is it used? State the importance of Hypothesis testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Hypothesis testing is a statistical technique that allows us to make inferences about a population based on sample data. The goal of hypothesis testing is to determine whether a certain hypothesis about the population is supported by the available evidence or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea behind hypothesis testing is to start with a null hypothesis, which is the hypothesis that there is no difference or no effect in the population. Then, we collect data from a sample and calculate a test statistic, which measures the difference or effect observed in the sample. We compare the test statistic to a critical value or a p-value to determine whether the evidence supports the null hypothesis or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing is used in many fields, including science, engineering, medicine, economics, and business, to test theories, make predictions, and make decisions based on data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing can help us to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Evaluate whether an observed effect or difference is statistically significant or due to chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Compare two or more groups or treatments to determine if there is a significant difference between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Test whether a certain relationship or association exists between two or more variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Make decisions based on data, such as accepting or rejecting a product, adopting a new policy, or investing in a new technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of hypothesis testing lies in its ability to provide a systematic and objective way to test hypotheses and make decisions based on data. By using hypothesis testing, we can avoid making decisions based on intuition, opinion, or personal bias, and instead rely on empirical evidence and statistical analysis. Hypothesis testing can also help us to identify areas where further research or data collection is needed to improve our understanding of the population and the factors that influence it.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans. Student's t-distribution is a probability distribution that arises when trying to estimate the mean of a normally distributed population in situations where the sample size is small and/or the population standard deviation is unknown . The t-distribution is similar in shape to the normal distribution, but has fatter tails, which reflects the increased uncertainty in small samples.\n",

    "In general, the t-distribution is used in statistical inference for hypothesis testing, confidence interval estimation, and sample size determination. Specifically, the t-distribution is used when the sample size is small and/or the population standard deviation is unknown . When the sample size is large, the t-distribution becomes very similar to the standard normal distribution."

It is typically used in hypothesis testing to determine whether the sample mean is significantly different from the population mean.\n",
