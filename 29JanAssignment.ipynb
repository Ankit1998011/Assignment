    "1. Who developed Python Programming Language?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. It was initially designed by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and developed by Python Software Foundation. It was mainly developed for emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Which type of Programming does Python support?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Python is an interpreted programming language, supporting object-oriented, structured, and functional programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Is Python case sensitive When dealing with identifiers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Yes, Python is a case-sensitive language, i.e., it treats uppercase and lowercase characters differently. This applies to identifiers too.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is correct extension of the Python file?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. The correct file extension for Python files is .py.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Is Python code compiled or interpreted?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Python is both compiled as well as an interpreted language, which means when we run a python code, it is first compiled and then interpreted line by line.\n",
    "\n",
    "The source code in python is saved as a . py file which is then compiled into a format known as byte code, byte code is then converted to machine code.\n",
    "     \n",
    "6. Name a few blocks of code used to define in Python language?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. A Python program is constructed from code blocks. A block is a piece of Python program text that is executed as a unit. The following are blocks: a module, a function body, and a class definition. Each command typed interactively is a block. \n",
    "\n",
    "To indicate a block of code in Python, you must indent each line of the block by the same amount.\n",
    "     \n",
    "7. State a character used to give single-line comments in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. We can write a single-line comment by adding a single # character before any statement or line of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Mention functions which can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. The function sys.version can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on.\n",
    "First we have to:\n",
    "\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "print(sys.version)\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime, using a construct called?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Python supports the creation of anonymous functions (i.e. functions that are not bound to a name) at runtime, using a construct called lambda. Lambda functions are restricted to a single expression. They can be used wherever normal functions can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "for ex: to find sum of two numbers:-\n",
    "\n",
    "sum_result = lambda x,y: x+y\n",
    "\n",
    "sum_result(2,3)\n",
    "\n",
    "output:- 5\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What does pip stand for in python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. pip is one of the most famous and widely used package management system to install and manage software packages written in Python and found in Python Package Index (PyPI). Pip is a recursive acronym that can stand for either \"Pip Installs Packages\" or \"Pip Installs Python\". Alternatively, pip stands for \"preferred installer program\".\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Mention a few built in functions in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Few built in functions in python are:-\n",
    "\n",
    "1.print():- Prints the values to a stream, or to sys.stdout by default.\n",
    "2.len():- Return the number of items in a container.\n",
    "3.input():- Read a string from standard input.  The trailing newline is stripped.\n",
    "\n",
    "and many others.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. What is maximum possible length of an identifier in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.\"Python identifiers are unlimited in length\" but as per PEP-8 you should limit identifier to a maximum of 79 character for better readability but there is no restriction.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What are the benefits of using Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Few benefits of using Python are:-\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Extensive support libraries(NumPy for numerical calculations, Pandas for data analytics, etc.) \n",
    "2.Open source and large active community base \n",
    "3.Versatile, Easy to read, learn and write\n",
    "4.User-friendly data structures \n",
    "5.High-level language \n",
    "6.Dynamically typed language(No need to mention data type based on the value assigned, it takes data type) \n",
    "7.Object-Oriented and Procedural  Programming language\n",
    "\n",
    "14. How is memory managed in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Memory in Python is managed by Python private heap space. All Python objects and data structures are located in a private heap. This private heap is taken care of by Python Interpreter itself, and a programmer doesn't have access to this private heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. How to install Python on Windows and set path variables?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. We can easily install Python by going to official Python website and downloading executable file and then running that executable file on our system.\n",
    "\n",
    "To set path follow the steps:\n",
    "Right click on My Computer ->Properties ->Advanced System setting ->Environment Variable ->New\n",
    "\n",
    "In Variable name write path and in Variable value copy path up to C://Python(i.e., path where Python is installed). Click Ok ->Ok.\n",
    "\n",
    "Path will be set for executing Python programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Is indentation required in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. The indentation in Python is very important. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code."
